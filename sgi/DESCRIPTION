Description: SGI (subgroup identification) toolbox provides an intuitive and powerful algorithm to automatically detect relevant subgroups of samples in large-scale omics datasets. 
              It is based on hierarchical clustering trees in combination with a specifically designed association testing and visualization framework that can process a large number of 
              clinical parameters and outcomes in an automated fashion. A multi-block extension allows for the simultaneous use of multiple omics datasets on the same samples.
